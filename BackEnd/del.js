const jsonString = '{"modified_title": "Empowering Users to Choose the Right Saliency Method for Machine Learning", "summarized_content": "MIT and IBM researchers have created a tool called saliency cards that helps identify the best saliency method for machine learning model they are using and the task that the model is performing. Saliency methods are techniques that explain how these large and complex models make predictions. The cards provide standardized documentation of a method’s strengths, weaknesses, and how it operates, including human-centric attributes. The cards would help users to accurately interpret their model’s predictions and avoid picking the wrong method that could lead to serious consequences. The researchers have hosted their work on the public repository."}'
